# Quantum Computing

This is a repo to understand Quantum Computing in a practical way.

The main objective is to create quantum gates through the simulation of a quantum computer. 

The simulation is based on the code from [this](./files/PAP-I.pdf) reference, 
which was my undergraduate professional project. 

To test the QC, a recreation of the quantum teleportation algorithm will be executed. 

The main objective of this simulation is to generate a Quantum computer of N qubits.

Project Organization:
------
- `files`: Folder containing relevant files for the proyect understanding and development.
- `notebooks`: Folder containing the corresponding jupyter notebooks to explore solutions.
- `quantum_computer_src`: Main code and executables rest in this folder.
- `README.md`: Main README.md file to understand the repo.
