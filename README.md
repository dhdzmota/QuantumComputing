# Quantum Computing

This is a repo to make a Simulation of a Quantum Computer based on the code from [this](./files/PAP-I.pdf) reference.

The main objective of this simulation is to provide a Quantum computer for N qubits. 

Specific objectives aim to generate quantum gates to generate general quantum algorithms.

Proyect Organization:
------
- `files`: Folder containing relevant files for the proyect understanding and development.
- `notebooks`: Folder containing the corresponding jupyter notebooks to explore solutions.
- `quantum_computer_src`: Main code and executables rest in this folder.
- `README.md`: Main README.md file to understand the repo.
